# Lotro Server Status Discord Bot  

A Discord bot built to monitor and provide updates on the server statuses for the game Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO). The bot allows users to check server statuses, monitor server changes, and receive real-time notifications when server statuses change.  

**ðŸ”—ðŸ¤– Add this bot to your Discord server [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1285998173294301234&permissions=2147567680&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands)! ðŸ¤–ðŸ”—**

**Update 24 Sep 2024: bot seems to be working as inteded (I recommend adding /monitor to it's own dedicated channel). New features added: bot now tracks status for Bullroarer and I added a /stop command that you can use in the same channel as /monitor to stop the auto monitoring server status updates**

## Known Issues  

1. Bot is currently being hosted for free on FPS. This means that I have to manually click on a button to add more running time to the bot (so if the bot is suddently offline my depest apologies). _I am working on a better alternative._

2. I can't really tell if ```/monitor``` is working as intended since servers don't seem to go up and down all the time. Any feedback on this is very much appreciated!
